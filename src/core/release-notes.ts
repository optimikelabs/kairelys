		title: 'When Tasks Become Projects',
		showOnUpdate: true,
		youtubeUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdxtmszDNm8',
		body: `
Some tasks stay small. Some become projects.

This release improves the second case. Operon now has better tools for seeing project structure, creating subtasks with the right context, and opening nested work without rebuilding your view by hand.

**Project Serials** add readable parent IDs to task trees. They make project relationships visible in the interface while keeping Operon's stable task IDs untouched.

**Selectable inheritance rules** make child tasks more predictable. You decide which parent fields should flow into new subtasks, and Status can either follow the parent pipeline or start from the default pipeline.

The contextual menu now understands more of the work around a task. **Subtasks**, **Create subtask**, **Checkboxes**, and especially **Dynamic Subtasks Filter** make it easier to open the right project layer from the task you are already looking at.

### New
- Added **Spanish localization**, including Settings language selection, translated UI strings, Spanish date parsing, calendar wording, task editing labels, and filter surfaces.
- Added **Project Serials** for parent task trees, showing read-only visual serial chips without changing real Operon task IDs; serial display refreshes when settings change, prefixes can be renamed inline, and numbers removed from the end of a series can be reused while middle gaps remain reserved.
- Added **Parent-Child task inheritance** as a separate Relationships section with compact single-line field rows and Workflow Picker-style field tokens, so child tasks can inherit only the parent fields you choose while Status can start from either the parent pipeline or the default pipeline.
- Added **Subtasks**, **Create subtask**, and **Checkboxes** contextual menu actions, with migration for existing custom menus so the new actions appear in the intended order where supported.
- Added **Dynamic Subtasks Filter** as a centered contextual window for tasks that already have subtasks, with its own auto-expand limit, open-only toggle, locked filter template, higher desktop placement, page-preview layering, and a single close button.

### Fixed
- Fixed **Calendar toolbar** controls picking up preset dropdown styling, so navigation icons stay centered and the preset selector keeps its compact chevron on hover.
- Fixed **Kanban contextual Checkboxes** opening with leftover hover-menu text or tooltip fragments visible behind the checkbox popover.

		body: `
This release is a compact visual consistency pass for Operon's busiest surfaces. It reduces theme-related button noise across editors, pickers, calendars, sidebars, and tracking controls while adding a couple of practical improvements to file-task creation and saved preset filters.

### Improved
- Improved **Create file task** so running it without selected text, a source line, or an inline task opens Task Creator in File mode instead of immediately creating a placeholder file task.
- Improved **Calendar** and **Kanban** preset filter controls with compact Create, Edit, Choose, and Clear actions, making saved filters easier to build and adjust from preset settings while keeping the preset panel easier to scan.

### Fixed
- Fixed Obsidian theme button backgrounds showing gray fills over Operon's newer transparent bordered styling across Task Editor, Calendar toolbar, sidebars, lane controls, pickers, tracking session controls, and the tracked session editor modal.

		title: 'Color Picker, Workspace Tweaks, and Editor Polish',
		showOnUpdate: true,
		youtubeUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfjE2iPARiM',
		body: `
This update centers on the new **Color Picker** and **Color Palette** settings. Colors are now easier to find, compare, and adjust: searchable named colors, tone and hue controls, custom previews, copyable hex values, localized names, and a curated default palette make Operon's colors work for both quick search and manual tuning.

It also tightens the everyday interface surfaces where repeated task work happens: Calendar sidebars, Filter Builder, shared pickers, and the Task Editor.

## New
- Added a new **Color Picker** and **Color Palette** settings experience, with searchable named colors, tone and hue controls, custom color preview, copyable hex values, localized color names, and a curated default palette for Operon's 28 named colors.
- Added **Workspace Tweaks** settings for optional scrollbar hiding, Properties collapsing, and compact sidebar tab icons, so small Obsidian workspace refinements can be managed from Operon.
- Added a **Task Editor autosave delay** setting, so users can choose how quickly typing edits autosave after they pause while closing the editor still saves immediately.

## Improved
- Improved Calendar **Calendars** and **Task Pool** controls with a denser preset layout, a new **Finished Tasks** mode, clearer search feedback, remembered pool mode, and better keyboard behavior.
- Improved **Filter Builder** condition field selection with a searchable picker, making long canonical and custom key lists easier to scan.
- Improved Operon's **pickers** with bordered controls, clearer selected and hover states, and more consistent action styling across date, status, priority, repeat, list, relationship, estimate, icon, and custom field pickers.
- Improved the **Task Editor** with updated header controls, workflow fields, tracking sessions, duration summaries, description and notes sections, parent/subtask context, checkbox progress, localized progress labels, and a clearer dirty-state save indicator.

## Fixed
- Fixed **Task Editor file body** layout issues so file-body panels no longer start clipped or shifted when opened from file tasks or inline tasks.

		version: '1.3.0',
		date: '2026-06-11',
		title: 'Custom Keys across Operon',
		showOnUpdate: true,
		bannerUrl: 'operon-1-3-0-compact-ui.png',
		body: `
This release makes **Custom Keys** a much more powerful part of Operon. You can now define your own task keys in Settings and use them across the places where real task work happens: Task Editor, Task Creator, compact chips, filters, search, embedded filters, Kanban sorting, and Kanban swimlanes.

It also continues the calmer Operon interface direction from the previous release. Task editing, creation, picker controls, Pinned Tasks, FlowTime, Task Finder, and contextual menus now share more of the same compact, bordered, tool-like visual language.

## New
- Added **Custom Keys** management in Settings, giving user-defined task keys their own Core page with field types, icons, descriptions, usage indicators, ordering, and safer delete confirmation.
- Added support for **Custom Keys** across Task Editor, Task Creator, Live Preview field menus, compact task chips, Filter Builder, task search, embedded filter search, Kanban sorting, and Kanban swimlanes.
- Added dedicated **Custom Key pickers** for text, list, number, date, and datetime fields, so user-defined keys can be edited with controls that match their field type.
- Added **Custom Key suggestions** from existing vault frontmatter values, so text and list pickers can reuse values already present in matching properties, not only values indexed from Operon tasks.
- Added wikilink-aware **Custom Key** display, including plain labels, Page Preview support, and linked-note opening for wikilink-backed custom values where the chip is interactive.
- Added a **Kanban swimlane visibility** toggle for Custom Keys, so user-defined keys only appear as swimlane grouping options when explicitly enabled.
- Added a **mobile context menu auto-hide** setting so touch menus can close automatically after a user-defined delay.

## Improved
- Improved **Task Editor file body** spacing so heading collapse chevrons stay easier to see and click inside the embedded editor.
- Improved **Task Editor workflow pickers** with a compact icon rail, letting workflow fields open from field icons while existing values stay visible below.
- Improved **Task Editor workflow picker spacing** so the new icon rail is grouped more clearly with the Core section and has better separation from surrounding fields.
- Improved **New Operon Task** toolbar icons with hover tooltips that follow the selected task color or fall back to the accent color, making icon-only task fields easier to identify without changing the compact creator layout.
- Improved **New Operon Task**, **Task Finder**, **Kanban search scope**, **FlowTime**, **contextual task menus**, **Pinned Tasks**, and **plain checkbox list editor** controls with calmer bordered styling and clearer selected states.
- Improved **Time Session History** rows with hover-revealed secondary actions, finished-task replay buttons, softer finished-task borders, aligned task icons, centered task titles, calmer session counters, and clearer edit targets.
- Improved **Inline Tasks settings** spacing and active-row highlighting so conditional save-location fields feel cleaner and less crowded.
- Improved **Priority settings** with a bordered editor frame that matches Pipeline settings and keeps the Add Priority action visually grouped with the priority list.
- Improved **Settings Search** coverage for Location Map, Mobile Calendar, Mobile Kanban, Relationships, Recurrence, Tracker, and Pinned Dock settings in Obsidian 1.13.
- Improved table-like settings pages so State Icons, Task Finder, Context Menu, Task Editor, and Mobile Task Editor keep their stable native page rendering for custom rows, matrices, and picker lists.
- Improved **Recurrence settings** layout so YAML cleanup rules have clearer spacing, a cleaner section title, and a less crowded Add Property Cleanup Rule action.
- Improved task **note action** icons so Live Preview, Reading View, Filter rows, and file task overlays use the task color when available and fall back to the accent color.

## Changed
- Changed first-run **Pinned Tasks** defaults so pinned cards start without task-color tinting and active timer tasks are pinned automatically.
- Changed the new-user default for **Task Editor line numbers** to off, giving the file body panel a cleaner first-run editing view while keeping the setting available.

## Fixed
- Fixed **Pinned Tasks** sidebar mode so the floating dock hides immediately, stays hidden after restart, and the pinned tasks command opens the configured surface instead of reviving the dock.
- Fixed **Settings Search** subpages in Obsidian 1.13 so Keymapping, Interface, and Mobile settings open through stable native page shells instead of occasionally rendering blank or missing sections.
- Fixed **Kanban** optimistic card previews for multi-value swimlanes, so moving one tag, context, assignee, or Custom Key list value follows the same lane behavior as the saved write.

## Validation
- Local validation passed \`npm run check:local\` and \`git diff --check\`, including strict linting, production build, release guard, and 919/919 Phase 5 regression checks.

		title: 'A calmer visual direction for Operon',
		showOnUpdate: true,
		bannerUrl: 'operon-1-2-1-ui-polish-chips',
		body: `
I used this release to start tightening Operon's visual language. **Linear** has been one of the references in my head: calm, compact, structured, and very much a tool rather than a decorative app.

The first visible result is the new **task chip** direction, plus smaller polish passes across **Kanban**, **Calendar**, **filters**, **pickers**, and **menus**. Obsidian themes can make this tricky, so I am taking it gradually: a few elements per bump, tested against real workflows instead of chasing a huge redesign.

## Improved
- Refined Operon's **interface polish** across Task Chips settings, chips, pickers, Kanban, Calendar, Filter views, Task Creator, Task Finder, FlowTime, Time Session History, tooltips, and action menus with calmer colors, more structured corners, cleaner guide lines, better-aligned controls, consistent chip hover behavior, and focused subpages for dense chip settings.
- Improved **task contextual menus** on mobile with steadier long-press timing and shared behavior across task surfaces, so touch actions like **Unschedule** stay easier to reach.
- Improved **Dynamic File Task Filter** grouping and sorting so the current file task stays visible at the top, direct subtasks can be grouped below it, descendants stay nested under their parent, **Happens on** works as a sortable date field, and custom sort rules apply inside expanded subtask trees.

## Fixed
- Fixed remaining **Dynamic File Task Filter** and compact chip polish issues, including Live Preview width alignment after pane geometry changes, mobile Location Map chip previews, and duplicate compact chip CSS declarations.

		title: 'Normal checkbox workflows and Day Picker',
		showOnUpdate: true,
		youtubeUrl: 'https://youtu.be/AOE4Z_qBspw',
		body: `
This release gives **normal markdown checkboxes** a clearer role inside Operon workflows. Lightweight checklists now show progress beside file tasks and inline tasks. The **mini editor** keeps small checklist work close without converting checkboxes into Operon tasks.

It also brings the **Operon Day Picker** into more date surfaces. Date picking should feel familiar wherever you are working in Operon.

## New
- Added the **Operon Day Picker** across date and datetime fields, so choosing dates feels the same whether you are editing a task, creating one, filtering, setting recurrence, or working directly in Live Preview, Reading View, and the Inline Task Bar.
- Added a lightweight **normal checkbox workflow** for file tasks and inline Operon tasks. Plain markdown checklists now show progress in task rows and overlays, and a small editor lets you add, review, complete, extend, pin, and save checkbox items while keeping them as ordinary markdown.

## Improved
- Improved **Date Picker** suggestions so upcoming dates are easier to reach first, typed dates do not repeat above the calendar, short entries like \`22 d\` and \`22 m\` still find useful matches, and past dates stay available when you ask for them.
- Improved **Filter rows** and **file task overlays** so Operon subtasks and plain checklist progress are easier to tell apart, with clearer chips, shorter tooltips, and per-surface **Open checkboxes** controls.

## Fixed
- Fixed **Task Finder** rows looking squeezed under themes with broad modal button styling, including Velocity.
- Fixed **Task Editor** file body chips looking uneven under themes with broad modal button styling, including Velocity.
- Fixed completed recurring task history continuing to show future projected entries in **Calendar** when there is no open task left in the series.

		body: `
This release makes location a real task surface in Operon. The new Map picker tab and location chip previews are powered by the **Obsidian Maps** plugin, so Maps needs to be enabled for interactive maps; Places and Manual entry remain available for storing \`lat, lng\` coordinates.

## New
- Added **Location Map** support for the canonical \`location\` task field, with \`lat, lng\` coordinate storage, Places/Map/Manual picking in Task Creator and Task Editor, **Obsidian Maps**-powered chip previews, saved place markers, light-map settings, place-note visuals, and desktop preview controls for resizing, moving, and pinning maps.
- Added a **Calendar day title action** setting, so clicking or tapping day headers can either create/open the daily note or do nothing.

## Improved
- Improved **Calendar Time Grid**, **Date Picker**, and **Filter editing** behavior around the Location Map release, keeping the surrounding planning views steadier while location-aware task workflows become available.

## Changed
- Changed the **Repeat picker** to use a Reference date for recurrence anchoring instead of treating that picker value as Scheduled Date.

## Fixed
- Fixed indented inline tasks losing their markdown indentation after updates from the **Task Editor**.

		date: '2026-06-04',

		showOnUpdate: true,
		bannerUrl: 'operon-1-1-6-localization',
		body: `
This release brings Operon into German and French, while also tightening language switching and Tasks emoji recurrence conversion so multilingual task workflows feel more native.

## New
- Added **German localization**, including explicit Settings language selection, translated UI strings, German repeat summaries, pinned task surfaces, Task Finder scopes, time tracking session terminology, filter materialization messages, and the pinned sidebar task editor label.
- Added **French localization**, including explicit Settings language selection, translated UI strings, French natural-language date parsing, Task Finder wording, time tracking session terminology, Kanban labels, and filter materialization messages.
- Added **Tasks emoji conversion** support for \`🔁 every ...\` recurrence rules, so supported recurrence syntax becomes Operon repeat fields in both single-line and selection conversion while unsupported syntax is still preserved in the leftovers note.

## Fixed
- Fixed the **Settings language selector** so changing languages saves safely without rebuilding the current Settings page into a blank screen.
- Fixed **Turkish Settings translations** so Core, Keymapping, Recurrence, Status Icons, and Task Chips use consistent Turkish wording.
- Fixed the update **release notes popup** showing only the newest unseen release; it now shows the latest five releases, matching the Settings release notes view.

		title: 'Daily Note defaults and steadier pinned tasks',

		bannerUrl: 'operon-1-1-5-daily-note-default-dates',
		body: `
This release makes Daily Note task capture smoother, gives Operon a built-in place to revisit recent updates, and makes pinned task state more reliable across old and new storage paths.

## New
- Added a **See what's new** entry at the top of **Operon Settings**, opening a recent-updates window so users can review the latest Operon improvements, fixes, banners, and videos at any time.
- Added **Daily Note defaults** for new Operon inline tasks, letting users automatically fill Start Date and/or Scheduled Date from the note date while preserving explicit task dates.

## Improved
- Improved **pinned task syncing** by storing pin state in Operon's canonical plugin data package with legacy fallback, conflict-aware merges, and automatic tombstone cleanup.

## Fixed
- Fixed pinned tasks not auto-unpinning immediately after completion in some Task Editor and status update flows.
- Fixed pinned task migration so a malformed old state file no longer blocks importing valid legacy pinned cache data.
- Fixed Reading View inline task rendering so task metadata resolves from source lines more reliably, preventing raw \`{{...}}\` fields from leaking on desktop preview in edge cases.

		showOnUpdate: true,
		youtubeUrl: 'https://youtu.be/Jf8bItQUaUM',
		body: `
This release makes file-task notes more useful on their own and makes planning views easier to read when tasks include links.

## New
- Added **Dynamic File Task Filter** for YAML file tasks, showing an automatic filter surface with a customizable visible name, descendant-aware search, and subtask auto-expand limit at the top or bottom of the file body in Reading View and Live Preview without writing filter blocks into notes.
- Added a **Task Editor** setting to hide source line numbers in the file body panel, so users can keep the editor cleaner when line references are not needed.

## Improved
- Improved the **Dynamic File Task Filter** settings section by removing redundant intro copy and making the first setting description carry the essential context.
- Improved **Calendar and Kanban task titles** so normal wiki-links are clickable with Page Preview support while file-task links stay visually lightweight.
- Improved the **Dynamic File Task Filter** default icon to better distinguish the automatic file-task filter from ordinary saved filters.
- Improved the filter editor icon picker so saved filters and **Dynamic File Task Filter** use the same stable icon picker modal as pipeline and priority settings.
- Improved filter editor button feedback with accent hover states for add actions and a red hover state for Cancel.
- Improved the filter editor layout with aligned name, grouping, and sort controls, and gave **Dynamic File Task Filter** a sensible default sort preset users can change.
- Improved filter search results so flat search mode respects each filter's configured sort order, including embedded and **Dynamic File Task Filter** surfaces.

## Fixed
- Fixed file task overlay progress counts lingering after the last subtask was deleted.
- Fixed file task overlay double-check markers so they only appear when the linked task itself is complete and all descendants are complete.
- Fixed Kanban preset deletion in Settings leaving an empty native settings page instead of returning to the populated Kanban settings.

		body: `
This release tightens mobile Calendar layout behavior and makes **wiki-links** inside task titles behave like links instead of plain text.

## New
- Added a mobile Calendar Day and 3 Days all-day collapse button, so phone users can temporarily give the time grid more room without changing Calendar settings.

## Fixed
- Fixed mobile Calendar Day and 3 Days views stopping short of the bottom of the panel by sharing the Agenda layout's bottom clearance behavior.
- Fixed Operon custom views being disrupted by **Self-hosted LiveSync**'s in-editor status overlay while keeping LiveSync sync behavior unchanged.
- Fixed the Task Editor **status picker** becoming unavailable after changing the status once.
- Fixed **wiki-links** in Filter view task titles rendering as plain text instead of Obsidian links with Page Preview support.
- Fixed file-task **wiki-link** overlays in Filter views and task rows so overlay chips, quick actions, status-colored icons, and escaped/code/embed-style wiki-links behave consistently.

		showOnUpdate: true,
		bannerUrl: 'operon-1-1-1-blocked-tasks',
		body: `
This release makes blocked dependencies easier to understand and brings Operon settings into Obsidian's searchable Settings experience.

## New
- Added a **blocked-task dialog** for dependency-blocked tasks, showing why a status change was prevented and offering quick actions for blocker tasks.
- Added **Obsidian 1.13 Settings Search** support for Operon settings while preserving the existing settings UI on older Obsidian versions.

## Improved
- Improved **dependency handling** so \`blocking\` and \`blockedBy\` stay synchronized, reject invalid self-links or cycles, repair missing inverse links after indexing, and appear consistently in chips, filters, Task Finder, file task overlays, and the mobile Task Editor.
- Improved Operon's **settings experience** with searchable native Settings pages, modal icon pickers, grouped sections, clearer wording, and consistent input styling across complex settings pages.
- Improved plugin storage handling by moving canonical settings, state, runtime, and cache data into Obsidian's plugin configuration area, with safer \`data.json\` reloads, legacy fallback, and manual \`.operon\` cleanup.
- Improved Calendar and Kanban preset editors with Save and Cancel actions, so draft changes can be reviewed or discarded consistently before updating views.
- Improved mobile Calendar Day and 3 Days empty-slot taps so they open the slot action dialog instead of jumping straight into Task Creator, matching desktop behavior and allowing task assignment or tracked-session creation first.
- Improved status and state icon controls with a more compact State Icons fallback dropdown and easier-to-scan status picker spacing.

## Changed
- Moved Operon's canonical plugin data from the legacy vault-root \`.operon\` folder into Obsidian's plugin configuration storage, leaving \`.operon\` as a read-only migration fallback.

## Fixed
- Fixed **dependency blocking** so active \`blockedBy\` predecessors prevent completion and workflow status changes from status cycling, checkbox completion, Task Editor saves, Live Preview updates, Kanban moves, and timer-start automation.
- Fixed dependency validation so multi-field edits, passive repairs, and Task Creator drafts reject invalid dependency graphs before writing files or inverse links.

## Validation
- Local validation passed \`npm run check:local\`, including strict linting, production build, release guard, and 754/754 Phase 5 regression checks.
