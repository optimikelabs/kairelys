# Plain checkbox lists

Every Operon task can carry its own list of plain Markdown checkboxes. This is a lightweight hierarchy layer that sits below the task: a quick checklist of steps that do not each need to be a full task. Both inline tasks and file tasks can have one, and the checkboxes always live in Markdown, in the same file.

## Two scopes

Where the checkboxes live depends on the task shape:

- **Inline task**: the plain checkbox lines nested under that inline task. They belong to the task through its `operonId`, so each inline task keeps its own list even when several sit in the same note.
- **File task**: the plain checkbox lines in the file body. The whole note is the task, so its body is where the checklist lives.

In both cases these are ordinary `- [ ]` Markdown checkboxes. They have no `operonId`, no fields, and no presence in filters or Calendar of their own. That is the point: they are simple sub-steps, not tasks.

## How checkboxes are parsed

Operon decides which checkboxes belong to which task by reading the note from top to bottom. The rules are few and, once you know them, the layout is predictable. This is exactly what the popover gathers when you open it on a task.

- **A checkbox belongs to the nearest task above it.** As Operon reads down the note, each Operon task line it passes becomes the current task. The plain checkbox lines after it belong to that task, until the **next** Operon task line appears and takes over. So the checkboxes sitting between one inline task and the next belong to the first one.
- **Position decides belonging, not indentation.** A checkbox does not have to be indented under its task; it is claimed by where it sits in the note, not by how deeply it is indented. Indentation is yours to use for readability and does not change which task a checkbox belongs to.
- **A file task's checkboxes are the ones in its note body.** Because the whole note is the task, the plain checkboxes anywhere in its body are its list. The frontmatter is skipped.
- **Several list styles count as a checkbox.** A line is read as one whether it starts with `-`, `*`, `+`, or a number such as `1.` or `1)`, as long as it carries the `[ ]` box.
- **Any mark means done.** An empty box `[ ]` is open; a box with anything inside it, such as `[x]`, `[/]`, or `[-]`, is treated as complete.
- **Code blocks are ignored.** Checkbox-looking lines inside a fenced code block are skipped, so an example in your writing is never mistaken for a real checklist item.
- **Checkboxes have no identity.** They carry no `operonId` and no fields, and they never surface in filters or the Calendar. They exist only as sub-steps of the task that owns them.

## When you convert an inline task to a file task

A checklist is part of a task, so it should travel with the task. When you convert an inline task that has checkboxes into a [[DOCS-013 File tasks|file task]], Operon **moves those checkboxes into the new note**, placing them at the top of the file task body, and removes them from where the inline task used to be. Nothing is duplicated and nothing is left behind: the steps stay attached to the same task in its new shape, so the work holds together across the conversion.

This is controlled by **Move checkboxes when converting inline tasks** (Settings → Operon → Tasks → File Tasks), which is on by default. Turn it off if you would rather leave the checkboxes where they were. See [[DOCS-019 Converting inline and file tasks|Converting inline and file tasks]].

## The checkbox popover

You edit the list through a small popover editor rather than scrolling to the lines by hand. Open it with the **Checkboxes** action in the [[DOCS-042 Contextual menu actions|contextual menu]] of a task. Inside the popover you can:

- **Add checkbox** a new line.
- Edit the **checkbox text**.
- Toggle items complete.
- **Move** the editor, or **close** it when done.

Changes are written straight back to the Markdown. If the file changes underneath an open editor, Operon asks you to reopen it before saving so edits never collide.

## Where you can open it

The checkbox popover is reachable from several surfaces, so you rarely have to leave what you are doing:

- The **Checkboxes** action in the contextual menu.
- The **Open checkboxes** chip in [[DOCS-025 Filter View|filter]] rows, which also shows checklist progress.
- [[DOCS-103 Task Wikilink Overlay|Task Wikilink Overlays]], via the **Open checkboxes** action.
- The **Show checkboxes** view in the [[DOCS-021 Task Editor|Task Editor]].

## Progress rollup

A task with checkboxes shows how far along the list is: not started, a percent complete, or complete. This gives you a sense of a task's internal progress without opening it, and without turning every sub-step into its own task.

## Checkboxes or subtasks?

Operon gives you two ways to break a task down, and they are not the same layer:

- **Plain checkboxes**: quick, in-file steps with no identity. Best for a short checklist inside one task.
- **Subtasks**: full Operon tasks with their own `operonId`, fields, scheduling, and views. Best when a step deserves to be tracked, scheduled, or found on its own. See [[DOCS-016 Parent and sub-tasks|Parent and sub-tasks]].

Reach for checkboxes when you just need to tick things off. Reach for subtasks when a step is real work in its own right.
