# Pinned Task Dock

The Pinned Task Dock keeps a chosen set of tasks always in view, so the work you care about most stays one glance away while you move around the vault. It is a small, persistent surface for "the few things I am actually on right now." You can pin [[DOCS-011 Inline tasks|inline tasks]] and [[DOCS-013 File tasks|file tasks]] together on the same dock, so your focus list is not split by how each task is written.

## Pin a task

Pin a task from its [[DOCS-042 Contextual menu actions|contextual menu]] with **Pin task**, and remove it later with **Unpin task**. Pinned tasks stay on the dock across notes and sessions until you unpin them.

## Two surfaces: floating dock or side panel

You can show your pinned tasks in either of two places:

- A **floating dock** over your notes. Toggle it with **Toggle Pinned Tasks dock**.
- A **side panel**, like a normal Obsidian sidebar view. Open it with **Open Pinned Tasks**.

Which one you get is a setting. In **Settings → Operon**, the pinned-tasks surface can be set to the dock or the sidebar, and when you use the sidebar you can choose the left or right side. On smaller screens the sidebar can be the more comfortable choice.

## Acting on pinned tasks

The dock is not just a list. Each pinned task offers the same contextual actions as anywhere else, so you can open the [[DOCS-021 Task Editor|Task Editor]], change status, start a timer, or mark it done without leaving what you are doing. See [[DOCS-042 Contextual menu actions|Contextual menu actions]].

Click a pinned task to open it in the [[DOCS-021 Task Editor|Task Editor]]. Hold **Cmd** (macOS) or **Ctrl** (Windows and Linux) and click to open the task's source in a new Obsidian tab instead: the note for a file task, or the exact line for an inline task, the same convention as opening a link in a new browser tab.

## FAQ

**Do pinned tasks stay after I close Obsidian?** Yes. Pins persist until you unpin them.

**Can I move it to the sidebar?** Yes. Set the pinned-tasks surface to the sidebar in settings, and pick the left or right side.

**Is pinning the same as priority?** No. Pinning is a personal "keep this in front of me" choice. Priority is a task field used for sorting and filtering. See [[DOCS-038 Task priorities|Task priorities]].

## Settings

Operon settings for this live in **Settings → Operon → Interface → Pinned Dock**, which configures the pinned tasks surface, floating dock or sidebar.
