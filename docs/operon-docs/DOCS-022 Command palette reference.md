# Command palette reference

Almost everything Operon does has a command in Obsidian's command palette. Open the palette and type `Operon` to see them. This page lists the commands by purpose.

Many commands are **context-aware**: the same command behaves differently depending on where you run it, such as on selected text, an empty line, an inline task, a normal note, a file task, or a task view. The descriptions below note when that matters.

This page is the index. The action commands link to a dedicated page with their full behavior; the view and feature commands link to the feature they open.

> **MEDIA-DOCS-022-1:** The command palette filtered to Operon, showing the available commands.

## Create tasks

- [[DOCS-084 Create New Operon Task|Create New Operon Task]]: opens the full [[DOCS-020 Task Creator|Task Creator]]. The safest starting point when you want Operon to guide you through the fields.
- [[DOCS-085 Create or edit inline task|Create or edit inline task]]: context-aware. On an empty line it creates a task; on plain text or a checkbox it converts or upgrades the line; on an existing task it opens the [[DOCS-021 Task Editor|Task Editor]].
- [[DOCS-086 Create file task|Create file task]]: creates a task that lives as its own note, optionally seeded from selected text or an inline task. See [[DOCS-013 File tasks|File tasks]].

## Edit and convert

- [[DOCS-087 Edit or convert to file task|Edit or convert to file task]]: edits the current file task, or converts a normal note into one.
- [[DOCS-088 Convert file task to inline task|Convert file task to inline task]]: collapses a file task back into a single inline task, then moves the old note to the Obsidian trash. See [[DOCS-019 Converting inline and file tasks|Converting inline and file tasks]].
- **Convert Tasks emoji line to inline task**: migrates a line written in the Obsidian Tasks emoji format into an Operon inline task. See [[DOCS-049 Obsidian Tasks migration|Obsidian Tasks migration]].
- **Convert Selection to Operon Tasks**: turns several selected lines into tasks at once. See [[DOCS-023 Create tasks from selected text|Create tasks from selected text]].

## Find and move

- **Task Finder**: search and jump to any task across the vault. See [[DOCS-027 Task Finder|Task Finder]].
- [[DOCS-089 Move an inline task here|Move an inline task here]]: picks a task with Task Finder and moves it to the current cursor line.
- [[DOCS-104 Add Task Wikilink Overlay|Add Task Wikilink Overlay]]: picks a task with Task Finder and inserts a link to it at the cursor, which renders as a [[DOCS-103 Task Wikilink Overlay|Task Wikilink Overlay]].

## State and time

- [[DOCS-090 Toggle task completion|Toggle task completion]]: completes or reopens the task at the cursor.
- **Start/stop time tracker**: starts or stops the timer on the task at the cursor. See [[DOCS-034 Time tracking|Time tracking]].

## Open views

- **Operon Filter View**: filtered, saved task lists. See [[DOCS-025 Filter View|Filter View]].
- **Operon Calendar**: scheduled and timed tasks on a calendar. See [[DOCS-028 Calendar overview|Calendar overview]].
- **Operon Kanban**: tasks as cards in workflow columns. See [[DOCS-030 Kanban overview|Kanban overview]].
- **Toggle Pinned Tasks dock** / **Open Pinned Tasks**: the floating dock or the side panel of pinned tasks. See [[DOCS-032 Pinned Task Dock|Pinned Task Dock]].
- **Open Time Session History panel**: review and edit tracked sessions. See [[DOCS-053 Time session history|Time session history]].
- **Open FlowTime panel**: start a focused work session. See [[DOCS-035 FlowTime focus sessions|FlowTime focus sessions]].

## Maintenance

- [[DOCS-091 Rebuild full index|Rebuild full index]]: re-scans the vault for tasks. Use it when tasks are missing or a file was edited outside Obsidian. See [[DOCS-054 Missing tasks|Missing tasks]].
- **Reload Operon settings from storage**: reloads Operon settings from disk.
- [[DOCS-092 Show index stats|Show index stats]]: a quick count of total, open, due-today, and overdue tasks.
- **Open duplicate operonId manager**: resolves tasks that share the same `operonId`. See [[DOCS-055 Duplicate IDs|Duplicate IDs]].
- **Repair Task Wikilink Overlay Links**: scans the vault and repairs stale inline `[[File#-operonId]]` links so their overlays resolve again. See [[DOCS-103 Task Wikilink Overlay|Task Wikilink Overlay]].
- **Update External Calendars**: refreshes configured external calendar sources. See [[DOCS-048 External calendars|External calendars]].
