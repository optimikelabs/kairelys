# Mobile Kanban

On a phone, a full [[DOCS-030 Kanban overview|Kanban]] board is too wide to use comfortably, so Operon switches it to a **touch-first layout** built for a narrow screen. It is the same board, with the same columns and [[DOCS-074 Kanban swimlanes|swimlanes]], but the way you move through it is tuned for a thumb instead of a mouse. This page covers what changes on mobile and the settings that shape it.

> **MEDIA-DOCS-100-1:** A Kanban board on a phone.

## When the mobile layout takes over

Two settings decide this. **Enable mobile Kanban layout** turns the touch behavior on, and it is on by default. **Mobile Kanban layout max width** sets the width at or below which a touch Kanban view uses that layout, so the board adapts on a narrow screen and stays in its desktop form on a wide one. The default cutoff is 900 px, adjustable between 600 and 1200.

This is why the same board can look one way on your phone and another on a tablet or desktop: it is the view's width, not the device alone, that flips the layout.

## Status snap: one column at a time

The headline of the mobile layout is **horizontal status snap**, on by default. With it on:

- Horizontal scrolling **settles on whole status columns** rather than stopping mid-column, so you always land on a clean column instead of a sliver of two.
- Dragging a card near the **side edges** advances it by a whole column, so you can move a card across statuses without needing the next column already on screen.

Together these make a narrow board feel like flipping through columns one at a time, which is far easier than free-scrolling a wide board on a small screen. Turn the snap off if you prefer continuous horizontal scrolling.

## The compact swimlane rail

When the board is grouped into [[DOCS-074 Kanban swimlanes|swimlanes]], the mobile layout shows each lane as a thin **colored rail** down the side rather than a full labeled header, to save width for the cards themselves. Two settings tune it:

- **Mobile Kanban swimlane rail width** sets how wide that colored rail is, from 6 px (a slim stripe, the default) up to 48 px.
- **Always show swimlane rail**, on by default, keeps the rail visible at all times. Turn it off and the rail appears only after you scroll horizontally, freeing a little more room until you need the cue.

## Task chips on mobile cards

Mobile Kanban uses the same **Kanban Task Chips** settings as desktop Kanban, so the chips you choose for cards stay visible on a phone too. On mobile they are read-only: tapping a chip does not open a picker, link, preview, location map, or action. Kanban cards do not show hidden-chip `+N` counts on mobile.

That keeps card gestures predictable. Tap the card to open it, scroll the board normally, and long-press the card itself when you want to drag. If space is tight, use Icon Only or a shorter Kanban chip order in **Settings → Operon → Interface → Task Chips → Kanban Task Chips**.

## The quick-create button

The mobile quick-create button (the floating plus) appears over Operon's mobile surfaces, including Kanban. If you would rather keep the board clear, you can **hide it while a Kanban view is active** without turning it off elsewhere. That toggle lives with the other mobile interface settings; see [[DOCS-101 Mobile General|Mobile General]].

## Settings

Operon settings for this live in **Settings → Operon → Mobile → Kanban**: **Enable mobile Kanban layout**, the **layout max width** that decides when it applies, the **swimlane rail width**, **Always show swimlane rail**, and **horizontal status snap**. Card chip visibility and order live in **Settings → Operon → Interface → Task Chips → Kanban Task Chips**. The setting to hide the quick-create button in Kanban is on the [[DOCS-101 Mobile General|Mobile General]] page.

## FAQ

**My board does not switch to the mobile layout.** Check that Enable mobile Kanban layout is on, and that the view's width is at or below the layout max width. A wide view keeps the desktop layout.

**Cards jump to the next column when I drag near the edge. Why?** That is status snap moving the card by a whole column. Turn off horizontal status snap if you want free dragging instead.

**Where are the swimlane labels?** On mobile, swimlanes show as a compact colored rail to save space. Widen the rail, or use the board on a wider screen, to bring back the fuller lane presentation.

**Can I see the create button on my phone Kanban?** Yes, unless you hid it for Kanban. See [[DOCS-101 Mobile General|Mobile General]].
