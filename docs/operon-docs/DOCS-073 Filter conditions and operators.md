# Filter conditions and operators

A [[DOCS-025 Filter View|filter]] is built from **conditions**. Each condition tests one field, and the operators you can choose depend on that field's **property type**. This page is the reference for those operators, plus the **groups** that combine conditions into a real query. For a first hands-on filter, see [[DOCS-010 Build your first filtered view|Build your first filtered view]]; this page is what to reach for when you want the full set.

## What a condition is

A condition has three parts: a **field** (such as `status`, `dateDue`, or a custom key), an **operator** (such as "is" or "before"), and usually a **value**. Operon offers only the operators that make sense for the field's type, so a date field never shows text operators and a number field never shows date operators. See [[DOCS-018 Task properties|Task properties]] for the property types.

Some operators take **no value** at all, like "has any value" or "is today." A few date operators take a **number** instead of a date, like "under X days away." The condition row switches its input to match the operator you pick.

## Groups: all, any, none

Conditions live inside a **group**, and the group decides how they combine:

| Group | Meaning | Common name |
|---|---|---|
| All | Every condition must match | AND |
| Any | At least one must match | OR |
| None | No condition may match | NOT |

Groups can be **nested**: a group can hold other groups, so you can express "status is active AND (due this week OR priority is high)." This is how a filter goes from a flat list to a precise query.

> **MEDIA-DOCS-073-2:** A nested filter with an "all" group containing an "any" subgroup.

## Operators by property type

The operator list is chosen by the field's type. These are the full sets.

### Text

For text fields like the title or a text custom key:

`contains`, `does not contain`, `is`, `is not`, `starts with`, `ends with`, `has any value`, `has no value`, `property is present`, `property is missing`.

### Number

For number fields like `estimate`:

`equals`, `does not equal`, `less than`, `more than`, `not less than`, `not more than`, `divisible by`, `not divisible by`, `has any value`, `has no value`, `property is present`, `property is missing`.

### Date and Date & time

For date fields like `dateDue` and `dateScheduled` (date and time fields use the same set):

`date is`, `before`, `after`, `is today`, `not today`, `before today`, `after today`, `exactly X days ago`, `exactly X days away`, `under X days ago`, `under X days away`, `over X days ago`, `over X days away`, `this week`, `last week`, `next week`, `this month`, `last month`, `next month`, `day of week is`, `day of week is not`, `month is`, `month is not`, `has any value`, `has no value`.

The "X days" operators take a number, and "day of week is" and "month is" take a weekday or month number, so their input is numeric rather than a date picker.

### List and tags

For list fields like `assignees`, `contexts`, `links`, and `tags`:

`any item contains`, `any item starts with`, `any item ends with`, `no item contains`, `no item starts with`, `no item ends with`, `all items are`, `all items contain`, `count is`, `count is not`, `count less than`, `count more than`, `has any value`, `has no value`.

The `count` operators test how many entries the list has, which is useful for "has more than one assignee."

### Checkbox

For a task's open or closed state: `is open`, `is done`, `is cancelled`.

## File task property operators

A [[DOCS-115 File task property columns|file task property]] gets its operators from the same type-based lists above, with two differences that matter because a discovered property is not a field every task structurally has:

- **Checkbox is a real boolean here, not a task's open/closed state.** A file task property typed Checkbox uses `is true`, `is false`, `has any value`, `has no value`, `property is present`, `property is missing`, not the `is open` / `is done` / `is cancelled` set built-in Checkbox fields use.
- **Date, Date & time, List, and Tags gain `property is present` and `property is missing`.** A built-in date or list field does not need these, every task has that slot, but a discovered property may not exist on a given note's frontmatter at all, so these two operators let a condition tell "missing" apart from "present but empty."
- **Text and Number** use exactly the same operator lists as their built-in counterparts, since those already include `property is present` and `property is missing`.

## Structural conditions

A few conditions test a task's place in the system rather than a single field value:

- **Pinned**: `is pinned`, true for tasks on the [[DOCS-032 Pinned Task Dock|dock]].
- **Task tree**: `matches task tree`, for filtering by a task's parent or subtask relationship. See [[DOCS-016 Parent and sub-tasks|Parent and sub-tasks]].
- **Folder**: `is in folder tree`, true when the task's file sits inside a chosen folder.
- **Project Serial Group**: filters by a task's [[DOCS-097 Project serials|project serial group]], the prefix its serial carries. Use `has any project serial group` or `has no project serial group` to separate tasks that hold a serial from those that do not; `is any of` or `is none of` to pick specific groups from a searchable list, which also offers to select every group starting with a prefix; or `starts with` and `does not start with` to match groups by a prefix you type.

These let a filter say "anything under this project," "only pinned work," or "only tasks in the DOCS serial group," not just field comparisons.

## FAQ

**Why are some operators missing for my field?** The list is chosen by the field's property type. Change the field's type and the available operators change with it.

**How do I express OR?** Put the alternatives in an "any" group. Combine with an outer "all" group for AND plus OR together.

**Why did the value box disappear?** The operator you chose needs no value, like "is today" or "has any value."

**Why does a Checkbox condition on a frontmatter property say "is true" instead of "is open"?** It is a [[DOCS-115 File task property columns|file task property]], a real boolean, not the task's own open or closed state, so it gets `is true` / `is false` plus presence operators instead.
